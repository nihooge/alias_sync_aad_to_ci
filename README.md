# Alternate Email Sync 
This repository is provided as companion source code for the series of article published on Medium:
Alias synchronization from Azure Active Directory and Google CloudÂ Identity

## Disclaimer: 
This repository and its contents are not an official Google Product.

Please note that the proposed solution, the associated architecture and application code (Terraform/Workflow) are provided solely as an example and are not supported by Google in any way. It is not recommended to use this code as is in a production environment, as it has not been written or tested for this purpose. It is provided as a demonstration of a technical solution only. Its use or modification, in whole or in part, is your responsibility."

## Objectives
Get alternate email synchronization between Azure Active Directory and Google Cloud Identity

When new Azure Active Directories identities are synced to Cloud Identity, **there is no way to set up an mapping/sync for alias email as the AAD application does not support it.**

Thus the objective is to offer a workaround based on the following steps :

1. Detect identity creation / modification through Admin Logs
2. Filter and Sink the Admin Logs to a Pub/Sub topic
3. that launch an EventArc trigger
4. calling a Workflow 
5. where it gets externalIds["LOGIN_ID"] as mail value on AAD
6. and eventually set alias email with this value.

Please note that there are 2 different workflows:
- one when the identity is created : google.admin.AdminService.createUser event
- one when the externalIds["LOGIN_ID"] is changed : google.admin.AdminService.changeUserExternalId event

## Pre-requisites

### Activate Shared Data / Logs to GCP 
Follow [Share data with Google Cloud services - Google Workspace Admin Help](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9320190)
Logs store at organizations/{OrgId}/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity

### Create a custom role to read an User Identity and set the alias email
Follow [Create, edit, and delete custom admin roles](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/2406043?hl=en) to create a custom role with :
- Users>Read
- Users>Update>Add/Remove Aliases

### Custom role assignement to the service account executing the workflow
Assign this custom role to the executing workflow service account. Operation need to be done in the [admin console](https://admin.google.com/). 
Warning: this operation can be done only after deployment.

## How-to deploy
The terraform deployment create a new project and instanciate all the different components of the solution.

Thus, you should add a .tfvars file , with at least a value for :
- organization_id
- folder_id
- project_id
- billing_account_id

Please check and modify the backend.tf file to fill the correct value for your TFState backend.

Then you can proceed with the infrastructure definition like any other terraform code.
